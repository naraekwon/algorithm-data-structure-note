# algorithm-data-structure-note
This note is created while I'm taking the [JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) at Udemy by Colt Steele.

1. Big-O Notation
    * Mathematical notation that describes algorithm effeiciency
    * Time & Space complexity
    * Describes the growth rate of algorithms
    * Logarithm
    * O(1), O(N), O(N^2)

2. Analyzing performance of Arrays and Objects

3. Problem Solving Approach

4. Problem Solving Patterns

5. Recursion

6. Searching Algorithms

7. Sorting


1. Data Structure Intro
2. Singly Linked Lists
3. Doubly Linked Lists
4. Stack/Queue
5. Tree
6. Map/Hash
7. Graphs
    1. Graphs
        * *Graph data structure* consists of a finite(and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected *graph* or a set of ordered pairs for a directed *graph*.
        * Nodes + Connections
        * Uses for graphs: 
            * Social Networks / Recommendations
            * Location / Mapping
            * Routing Algorithms
            * Visual Hierarchy
            * File system Optimizations
            * **Everywhere!**
        * Essential Graph Terms
            * Vertex - a node
            * Edge - connection between nodes
            * Weighted/Unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices
            * Directed/Undirected - directions assigned to distanced between vertices
    
8. Dynamic Programming
